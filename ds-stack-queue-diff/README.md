## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
 Please write your explanation below.

    Both the stack and the queue have almost the same implementation however
    they function in different behaviours.

 This is how they differ from one another:

    Stack - 'LIFO'  - Last in First out
    Queue - 'FIFO' - First in First out

 How can we use them:

 STACK -

    The stack on the other had has the opposite of the 'FIFO' method of which the last person or
    element is served first and the first person or element is served last. it is exactly implemented
    as people walking into a bus or a train, where the first people in leave last.
    The priority is for the last person or element.


 QUEUE -

    We can implement the stack to create a ticket waiting application for hospitals or any
    other business for procedures to be taken in the FIFO method. For people to be served at the time
    of their arrival. It is easy to think about it as waiting in line and each person or element
    has a specific priority.
    The priority is for the first person or element.
